<center><strong>Yaroslav (Slava) Tkachenko</strong>, Software engineer</center>

&nbsp;

I started programming when I was 13, professionally since 17. Programming was always my passion and I never stop learning.

During my career I did a lot of different things, from slicing mockups to HTML/CSS and writing single page web apps to designing and building microservices architecture and implementing complex back-end services with Actor-based frameworks.

My current areas of interest:

- Distributed systems and microservices
- Back-end programming
- Infrastructure, DevOps tools and practices

You can find my experience, education and skills in the pages below.

## Experience

&nbsp;

### Bench Accounting

**Director of Engineering**, October 2015 - Present (1 year) | Vancouver, BC, Canada

**Engineering Lead**, April 2014 - September 2015 (1 year 6 months) | Vancouver, BC, Canada

**Software Engineer**, September 2011 - March 2014 (2 years 7 months) | Omsk, Russia (Remote) -> Vancouver, BC, Canada

In Bench Accounting I contributed to the growth and success of the company a lot. In the last 5 years:

- Company received $25M+ in funding
- Company had grown from 6 to 250+ employees
- Engineering team had grown from 3 to 30 engineers

My contributions touched the whole stack. When I joined the company I mostly worked on a front-end, rewriting multiple single page web apps, then focused more on API, back-end of the core services and integrations, and finally now I’m responsible for the whole Platform, including infrastructure work, DevOps tools and practices, core back-end services, integrations, microservices architecture and more.

I always cared a lot about projects we develop and products we ship. Everything from tiny UI elements to code quality and team motivation. I quickly became a leader for many initiatives and was promoted to the Engineering Lead. As an example, I led the transition from Java monolith app to Scala microservices.

I continued to improve not only our codebase and quality standards, but lots of processes like project management, onboarding experience and education. Now in my role as a Director of Engineering I’m responsible for managing multiple teams working on Platform, infrastructure, API and integrations, as well as participating in technical discussions, contributing to architecture and mentoring. Still, my sleeves are always rolled up and I’m helping teams with regular tasks all the time.
