# Agenda

- Microservices: stateless vs stateful
- Actor systems
- Akka
- Akka Cluster and Persistence
- Real-world applications

???

- Microservices = Services = "Applications"
- Use case is particularly good for Microservices

# Microservices: stateless vs stateful

**Stateless** application: application that doesn't keep any state in *memory* / *runtime*, but uses external services instead.
  - External service: database, cache, API, etc.
  - Examples: most of the web apps are stateless or designed to be stateless (Spring, Django, Rails, Express, etc.).

**Stateful** application: application that keeps internal state in *memory* / *runtime*, instead of relying on external services. 
- Examples: actors *can* be stateful, so Akka and other actor-based systems (Erlang/OTP, Orleans) can be stateful. But it's also possible to create stateful applications in Node.js or Python, for example.

---

# Microservices: stateless

Benefits:
- Simple development &amp; deployment
- Simple to scale out -> just add more nodes

Biggest challenges: 
- Low latency -> can use caching, but not when strong consistency is needed
- Concurrent modifications -> conflict resolution with optimistic / pessimistic locking

---

# Microservices: stateful

.center[
![](http://sap1ens-archive.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/pictures/stateful_microservices.png)
]

???

- Single instance is possible, but availability and scalability is poor 
- State is distributed accross nodes somehow
- LB knows the data location OR nodes can forward requests when needed

Don't have time for ring examples and explanation

---

# Microservices: stateful

Benefits:
- Data locality -> low latency, fast processing
- Sticky consistency -> "simple" and "cheap" consistency without using consensus protocols

Biggest challenges: 
- High availability 
- Scaling out

# Actor systems

---

# Actor systems

An actor is a computational entity that, in response to a message it receives, can concurrently:

- send a finite number of messages to other actors;
- create a finite number of new actors;
- designate the behavior to be used for the next message it receives.

There is no assumed sequence to the above actions and they could be carried out in parallel.

<br />

Every actor has:

- A mailbox
- A supervisor
- Some state [optionally]

???

- Messages are sent async
- It's ok to have millions of actors in one VM/node, they're cheap

# Akka

---

# Akka 

Akka is an open-source toolkit and runtime simplifying the construction of concurrent and distributed applications on the JVM. 

Akka supports multiple programming models for concurrency, but it emphasizes actor-based concurrency, with inspiration drawn from Erlang.

---

# Akka - Actors

```scala
case class Greeting(who: String)
 
class GreetingActor extends Actor with ActorLogging {
  def receive = {
    case Greeting(who) => log.info("Hello " + who)
  }
}
 
val system = ActorSystem("MySystem")
val greeter = system.actorOf(Props[GreetingActor], name = "greeter")
greeter ! Greeting("Charlie Parker")
```

&nbsp;

- Messages are handled one by one
- Immutability of messages

---

# Akka - Communication

```scala
class HelloActor extends Actor with ActorLogging {
  def receive = {
    case who => sender() ! "Hello, " + who
  }
}

object ConversationActor {
  def props(fellowActor: ActorRef): Props = Props(classOf[ConversationActor], fellowActor)
}

class ConversationActor(fellowActor: ActorRef) extends Actor with ActorLogging {
  def receive = {
    case "start" => fellowActor ! "it's me!"
    case message => log.info(message)
  }
}
 
val system = ActorSystem("MySystem")

val helloActor = system.actorOf(Props[HelloActor])
val conversationActor = ConversationActor.props(helloActor)

conversationActor ! "start"
```

# Actor systems and Akka - Why?

So, why actors?
- Simple concurrency
- Clean asynchronous programming model
- Great fit for event-driven systems
- Resilience
- Scalability

---

# Akka Persistence - Overview

- Event Sourcing
- Persistent Actor
- Journal
- Snapshot

Has plugins for JDBC (MySQL, Postgres, ...), MongoDB, Cassandra, Kafka, Redis and more.

---

# Akka Persistence - Example

```scala
case class Cmd(data: String)
case class Evt(data: String)
 
case class ExampleState(events: List[String] = Nil) {
  def updated(evt: Evt): ExampleState = copy(evt.data :: events)
  override def toString: String = events.reverse.toString
}
 
class ExamplePersistentActor extends PersistentActor {
  override def persistenceId = "sample-id-1"
 
  var state = ExampleState()
 
  def updateState(event: Evt): Unit = 
    state = state.updated(event)
 
  val receiveRecover: Receive = {
    case evt: Evt => updateState(evt)
    case SnapshotOffer(_, snapshot: ExampleState) => state = snapshot
  }
 
  val receiveCommand: Receive = {
    case Cmd(data) => persist(Evt(data))(updateState)
    case "snap"  => saveSnapshot(state)
    case "print" => println(state)
  }
}

# Akka Cluster - Sharding

Features:
- One of the most powerful Akka features!
- Allows to route messages across nodes in a cluster using a sharding function (actually two)
- You don't need to know the physical location of an actor - cluster will forward message to a remote node if needed
- Uses Akka Persistence internally (or brand-new Distributed Data)

Concepts:
- Coordinator
- Shard Region
- Shard
- Entity

Entities (actors) are "activated" by receiving a first message and can be "passivated" using `context.setReceiveTimeout`.

???

- Cluster has only one coordinator as a singleton
- Ideal number of shards = max(nodes) * 10
- Every shard contains set of entities

---

# Akka Cluster - Sharding

Counter interface:

```scala
case object Increment
case object Decrement
final case class Get(counterId: Long)
final case class EntityEnvelope(id: Long, payload: Any)
 
case object Stop
final case class CounterChanged(delta: Int)
```

---

# Akka Cluster - Sharding

Counter implementation:

```scala
class Counter extends PersistentActor { 
  context.setReceiveTimeout(120.seconds)
 
  override def persistenceId: String = "Counter-" + self.path.name
 
  var count = 0
 
  def updateState(event: CounterChanged): Unit =
    count += event.delta
 
  override def receiveRecover: Receive = {
    case evt: CounterChanged ⇒ updateState(evt)
  }
 
  override def receiveCommand: Receive = {
    case Increment      ⇒ persist(CounterChanged(+1))(updateState)
    case Decrement      ⇒ persist(CounterChanged(-1))(updateState)
    case Get(_)         ⇒ sender() ! count
    case ReceiveTimeout ⇒ context.parent ! Passivate(stopMessage = Stop)
    case Stop           ⇒ context.stop(self)
  }
}
```

---

# Akka Cluster - Sharding

Create a region on every node:

```scala
val counterRegion: ActorRef = ClusterSharding(system).start(
  typeName = "Counter",
  entityProps = Props[Counter],
  settings = ClusterShardingSettings(system),
  extractEntityId = extractEntityId,
  extractShardId = extractShardId)
```

Sharding functions:

```scala
val extractEntityId: ShardRegion.ExtractEntityId = {
  case EntityEnvelope(id, payload) ⇒ (id.toString, payload)
  case msg @ Get(id)               ⇒ (id.toString, msg)
}
 
val numberOfShards = 100
 
val extractShardId: ShardRegion.ExtractShardId = {
  case EntityEnvelope(id, _) ⇒ (id % numberOfShards).toString
  case Get(id)               ⇒ (id % numberOfShards).toString
}
```

---

# Akka Cluster Sharding + Persistence = ❤️️

Akka Cluster Sharding: 
- Consistent hashing for all requests based on user-defined function
- Automatic forwarding (from local to remote and vice versa)

Akka Persistence: 
- Keeping internal state
- Easy and fast recovery (journal + snapshots)
- Event-sourcing built-in

# Real-world applications

---

# Real-world applications

- Complex event-driven state machine with low latency API (aka **The Tracker**)
- More (online gaming, data aggregation, trading, complex domains, ...)

---

# Real-world applications - The Tracker

Complex event-driven state machine:

Consuming: 
- Domain Events via messaging queue (Akka Camel)

Interface for querying: 
- HTTP API (Akka HTTP)
- Websockets (Akka HTTP)

Every entity has a **clientId** and they never intersect - it's a perfect use-case for sharding (clientId as a sharding key).

---

# Real-world applications - The Tracker

```scala
object TrackerService {
  case class TrackerData(
    accounts: Map[String, BankAccount] = Map[String, BankAccount]()
  )
}

class TrackerService extends PersistentActor {
  private var state = TrackerData()

  private def handleMessage(message: EventMessage) {
    val maybeUpdatedState = message match {
      case b: BankAccountMessage => handleBankMessage(b)
      case c: ClientMessage => handleClientMessage(c)
      case _ => None
    }
    maybeUpdatedState.foreach { updatedState =>
      updateState(updatedState)
    }
  }

  private def updateState(updatedState: TrackerData) = {
    state = state.copy(
      accounts = (state.accounts ++ updatedState.accounts).filterNot(_._2.deleted)
    )
  }
}  
```

# Summary

- Actor-based programming simplifies building highly scalable and reliable systems
- It's not easy to build &amp; maintain a stateful application, but you never know when it's going to be needed
- Don't try to write abstractions for distributed programming from scratch (unless you're an expert)
- Akka has a few great abstractions already, use them!
- It's easier to build a stateful application as a microservice - smaller state size, more flexibility and great separation of concerns
