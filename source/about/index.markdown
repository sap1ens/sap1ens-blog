Hey, my name is Yaroslav (Slava) Tkachenko, I was born in Russia and I'm currently living in Vancouver, Canada.

I'm a software engineer, at the moment Senior Software Engineer, Lead at [Mobify](https://www.mobify.com).

I like functional programming and distributed systems, you can find more info about what I do below and in my [resume](/files/resume-yaroslav-tkachenko.pdf).

I also write a [blog](/blog/archives) and [participate](/talks) in conferences and meetups.

## A bit more

I love to travel, although not always have time for that. Currently [visited 11 countries](http://ru.igotoworld.com/en/visited-map/9924.htm) and adding more. I'm an occasional [photographer](https://www.instagram.com/sap1ens/), especially during my trips.

I also love cooking and enjoying great healthy food. I've been a vegetarian for a few years and I really appreciate my choice.

Mentoring and teaching is something I always excited to do, either in my current company via conversations, workshops, 1-to-1s and lunch & learns or public speaking. Writing is a big part of me too, at the moment I use my blog for that, but I hope that once I'll have time and expertise to write a book. That also means that I read A LOT, mostly [professional stuff](/blog/2014/10/13/how-and-what-i-read-as-a-software-engineer/), fiction (sci-fi, fantasy) and non-fiction (I like history and biographies).

Manchester United FC fan since 2002 ;-)
