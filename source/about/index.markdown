Hey, my name is Yaroslav Tkachenko and I'm Software Engineer from Russia, currently living in Vancouver, Canada.

I feel myself comfortable to be polyglot-programmer: right now I primarily use Scala and Java, as well as a lof of front-end stuff (from CoffeeScript to Flexbox). I also have experience with PHP and Python, and I'm looking forward to work with C/C++, Ruby and Erlang. I described all these things, because I truly believe that every problem has its own, ideal tool. And you should have a wide range of tools, not only a hammer (because [if all you have is a hammer ...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument)).

Btw, I work in a beautiful startup called [Bench](https://bench.co/) and we're going to conquer the world... someday.
