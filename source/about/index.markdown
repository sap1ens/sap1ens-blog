Hey, my name is Yaroslav (Slava) Tkachenko, I was born in Russia and I'm currently living in Vancouver, Canada.

I'm a software engineer, at the moment Director of Engineering at [Bench Accounting](https://bench.co).

I like functional programming and distributed systems, you can find more info about what I do below and in my [resume](/resume).

I also write a [blog](/blog/archives) and [participate](/talks) in conferences and meetups.

## Life

I love to travel, although not always have time for that. Currently visited 7 countries and adding 2 more in 2016. I'm an occasional photographer, especially during my trips.

I also love cooking and enjoying great healthy food. I've been a vegetarian for a few years and I really appreciate my choice.

Mentoring and teaching is something I always excited to do, either in my current company via conversations, workshops, 1-to-1s and lunch & learns or public speaking. Writing is a big part of me too, at the moment I use my blog for that, but I hope that once I'll have time and expertise to write a book. That also means that I read A LOT, mostly [professional stuff](http://localhost:4000/blog/2014/10/13/how-and-what-i-read-as-a-software-engineer/), fiction (sci-fi, fantasy) and non-fiction (I like history and biographies).

Manchester United FC fan since 2002 ;-)

## Work

If you ask me to describe myself in one word I would say "*hardworking*". If you allow more I will add "*always learning*".

I taught myself web development when I was 15 and got full-time job as a web developer at 17. Then I went through university (graduated with MSc in Computer Science), working in parallel (either for a company or freelancing), and tried to open my own outsourcing company. Things didn't work out, but I learned a lot and later joined [Bench Accounting](https://bench.co), working remotely from Russia.

By that time I knew web development pretty well, front-end and back-end (mostly PHP and some Python). My focus at Bench was on UI and front-end development when I started, but I worked on *everything* over 5 years: UI, Java and Scala back-ends, APIs, integrations, core services, infrastructure, DevOps, all kinds of testing. I moved to Canada in 2013 and started to contribute to the overall architecture and transitioning to microservices. I took even more responsibilities shortly after and I've been promoted to the Engineering Lead first and Director of Engineering a few years later.

Currently I'm still contributing a lot, but my focus shifted to back-end (mostly Java/Scala/Node.js), distributed systems, architecture and DevOps. I also manage a few teams (Platform, Integrations). I'm proud to say, that over the last few years I helped to scale Engineering department at Bench from **3 to 20+** engineers and established multiple domain-focused cross-functional Agile teams.

By the way, Bench [has recently closed](https://www.crunchbase.com/funding-round/81aa9f47e56b0067461729ac173b815b) **Series B** round with $16M from multiple top investors.
