Hey, my name is Yaroslav (Slava) Tkachenko, I was born in Russia and I'm currently living in Vancouver, Canada.

I'm a software engineer & architect, at the moment Principal Software Engineer at [Goldsky](https://goldsky.io).

I like data engineering and distributed systems, you can find more info about what I do below and in my [resume](/files/resume-yaroslav-tkachenko.pdf).

I also write a [blog](/blog/archives) and [present](/talks) at conferences and meetups.

## A bit more

I love to travel! Starting from 2012 I [visited 20 countries](http://ca.igotoworld.com/en/visited-map/9924.htm) and adding more. I'm an occasional [photographer](https://www.instagram.com/sap1ens/).

I enjoy mentoring, writing, reading non-fiction, long walks, and european football.
