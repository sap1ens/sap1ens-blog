Hey, my name is Yaroslav Tkachenko and I'm a Software Engineer from Russia, currently living in Vancouver, Canada.

I like programming, software design, distributed computing, algorithms, creating APIs, single-page web apps, and doing some DevOps. My primary tools right now are Java, Scala and lots of front-end stuff (from HTML5 to CoffeeScript). I also have experience with PHP and Python, and I will be happy to work with functional languages like Erlang or Haskell. I truly believe that every problem has its own, ideal tool, and you should have a wide range of tools, not only a hammer (because [if all you have is a hammer ...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument)).

I work as an Engineering Lead in a beautiful startup called [Bench Accounting](https://bench.co/) and we're going to conquer the world... someday.

Interests and hobbies: healthy vegetarian food and cooking, Ayurveda, photography, soccer, books.
