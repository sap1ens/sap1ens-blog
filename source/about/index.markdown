## Life

<img src="/images/pages/me_about_page.jpg" width="400" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 12px 12px;" />

I was born in Russia, but I'm currently living in Vancouver, Canada.

I love to travel, although not always have a time for that. Currently visited 7 countries and adding 2 more in 2016. I'm an occasional photographer, especially during my trips.

TODO

Interests and hobbies: healthy vegetarian food and cooking, photography, soccer, travel, writing, books.

## Work

If you ask me to describe myself in one word I will say "*hardworking*". If you allow more I will add "*always learning*".

I taught myself web development when I was **15** and got full-time job as a web developer at **17**. Then I went through university working (either for a company or freelancing) and tried to open my own shop at **20**. Things didn't work out, but then I joined [Bench Accounting](https://bench.co) working remotely from Russia.

By that time I knew web development pretty well, front-end and back-end (mostly PHP and some Python). My focus at Bench was on UI and front-end development when I started, but I worked on *everything* over 5 years: UI, Java and Scala back-ends, APIs, integrations, core services, infrastructure, DevOps, all kinds of testing. I moved to Canada at **23** (2013) and started to contribute to the overall architecture and microservices transitioning. I took even more responsibilities shortly after and I've been promoted to the Engineering Lead at **24** and Director of Engineering at **26**.

Currently I'm still contributing a lot, but my focused shifted to back-end (mostly Java/Scala/Node.js), distributed systems, architecture and DevOps. I also manage a few teams (Platform, Integrations). I'm proud to say, that over the last few years I helped to scale Engineering department at Bench from **3 to 20+** engineers and established multiple domain-based cross-functional Agile teams.

By the way, Bench [has recently closed](https://www.crunchbase.com/funding-round/81aa9f47e56b0067461729ac173b815b) **Series B** round with $16M from multiple top investors.

#### Interests

- I'm a big fan of functional programming and I'm trying to use it everywhere, even in Java or CoffeeScript. I have a lot of experience with Scala and different experience / interest / workshops with Haskell, Clojure and Erlang.
- I **love** to build distributed systems and microservices. My toolkit includes Domain Driven Design, Enterprise Integrations Patterns, Event sourcing, Domain modelling and actor-based systems (mostly Akka).
- I also like to contribute to the overall system infrastructure and use modern Cloud DevOps practices as much as possible.
