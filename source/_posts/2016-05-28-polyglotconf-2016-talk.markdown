Today I participated in [Polyglotconf](http://www.polyglotconf.com) 3rd year in a row. This time I was prepared though, I wanted to talk about microservices and different advantages and disadvantages you can have if you use messaging as your main internal communication protocol. Also, it makes perfect sense for me to use Actors to build the actual microservices and I tried to explain why.

It seems like this topic is quite popular nowadays and I got the biggest auditorium as well as dozens and dozens of interested people.
