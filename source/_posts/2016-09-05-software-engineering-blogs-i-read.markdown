RSS is not dead. At least not for me :) I use [NewsBlur](http://www.newsblur.com) to track and read 50+ various feeds - tech, travel, personal blogs. Today I want to share a list of software engineering blogs that I find very helpful and keep in my list for a long time.

<!-- more -->

<http://techblog.netflix.com> - Netflix has one of the best blogs. They always post very interesting articles explaining their architectural decisions in depth.

<http://martinfowler.com> - another must read, Martin Fowler. I don’t think he needs introduction :)

<https://aphyr.com/posts> - distributed systems explained (and ruined). His [Jepsen series](https://aphyr.com/tags/Jepsen) is a great practical introduction to distributed computing and related problems. He proves that everything can be broken (well, except Zookeeper).

<http://highscalability.com> - lots of “real life architectures” - [reviews](http://highscalability.com/blog/category/example) that explain modern scalable architectures from different companies, from startups to enterprises.

<https://github.com/blog/> - less actual engineering, but it’s important to be informed about new GitHub features, right?

<http://nerds.airbnb.com> - AirBnB shares interesting details about problems they solve.

<https://codeascraft.com> - the same from Etsy, their Performance Reports series is pretty unique.

<https://eng.uber.com> - insights from Uber, always in detail.

<https://www.paypal-engineering.com> - diverse topics from PayPal.

<http://code.hootsuite.com> - another really diverse blog from HootSuite: JVM, DevOps, front-end, etc.

<http://engineering.khanacademy.org> - really great content, sometimes not about engineering at all, [but take a look](http://engineering.khanacademy.org/posts/a-case-for-time-tracking.htm)!

<https://aws.amazon.com/new/> - must have stream of updates if you use Amazon Web Services.

<http://www.cakesolutions.net/teamblogs> - good DevOps and Scala content, weekly digests!

<http://blog.akka.io> - obviously useful only if you use Akka ;-) or planning to.

As a bonus a few great personal blogs:

- <http://jvns.ca>
- <http://ferd.ca>
- <http://tonsky.me>
