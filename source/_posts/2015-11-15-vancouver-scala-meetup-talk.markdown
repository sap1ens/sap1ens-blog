Last few months at Bench Accounting I've been working on an eventing system for our microservices stack. We outgrown our legacy system and had new requirements: new messaging app! So it was clear that we need something more flexible, robust and nicer to work with.

The new eventing system was finished a couple of weeks ago and it has been running in production for a while. This week I gave a talk at [Vancouver Scala](http://www.meetup.com/vancouver-scala/) meetup about the high-level overview of the system, implementation details and some challenges we faced.
