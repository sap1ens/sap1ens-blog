It can be surprise for somebody, but Agile project management sometimes requires more attention than classical waterfall methodologies.

From [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)): "Scrum enables the creation of self-organizing teams by encouraging co-location of all team members, and verbal communication among all team members and disciplines in the project.".

Self-organizing team, huh? It's awesome idea, but actually there is one necessary requirement - passionate Scrum master. Without such person your team is like a boat full of rowers, but without steersman.

Choose the right person.
