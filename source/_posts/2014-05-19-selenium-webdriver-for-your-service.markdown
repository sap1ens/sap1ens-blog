During my career I constantly see the battle between people who own websites, web services and even search engines with people who try to break a system, find some backdoors or simply automate routine things with custom methods. 
I don't mean just hackers, there are a lot of interesting specialities like black SEO guys, programmers who write scrapers, ads clicker bots, etc.  

Today I'll talk about a need to emulate user's behaviour in a web browser. Usually you could find such fake users analyzing logs, HTTP headers or with more sophisticated tools, like checking JavaScript stuff. Web crawler probably doesn't support JavaScript you might think.
