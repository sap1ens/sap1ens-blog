Only in startup you can spend your Monday creating new module for single-page app in CoffeeScript, Tuesday refactoring billing system in Java, Wednesday writing new endpoint for RESTful API in Scala, Thursday researching CSS Flexbox spec and Friday making changes for internal Node.js service.

This is priceless.
