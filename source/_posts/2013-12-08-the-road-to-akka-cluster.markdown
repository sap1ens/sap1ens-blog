Totally awesome [presentation](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/jonas-boner) about distributed computing and Akka Cluster by Jonas Bon√©r from Scala eXchange 2013. You should definitely spend 1 hour for it! Slides can be found [here](http://www.slideshare.net/jboner/the-road-to-akka-cluster-and-beyond).
